<v Instructor>Hello everyone and welcome to our module</v>

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.863 line:15% 
on cardiac anatomy.

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.260
Let's start by reviewing the major chambers of the heart.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.400
Blood enters the right atrium of the heart

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.950
via one of two structures.

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.070
The first is the superior vena cava,

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.330
which drains blood from above the heart.

8
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.990
The other is the inferior vena cava,

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.510
which drains blood from below the heart.

10
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.850
From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle

11
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.840
and from the right ventricle, it is pumped out

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.010
via the pulmonary artery and into the lungs.

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.820
After blood moves through the lungs,

14
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.050
it enters the left atrium of the heart

15
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.850
via one of four pulmonary veins.

16
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.700
You can find the entrance to the pulmonary veins

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.310
in the left atrium.

18
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.740
From the left atrium, blood moves into the left ventricle

19
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.140
and from there, it is pumped into the aorta.

20
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.600
Notice also in this picture

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.010
that the walls of the left ventricle

22
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.450
are drawn and they are thicker

23
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.200
than the walls of the right ventricle.

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.770
That is the same thing you see in the anatomy lab.

25
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.230
The reason the walls of the left ventricle

26
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.600
are thicker than the right ventricle

27
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.300
is because the left ventricle has to generate

28
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.810
much higher pressures

29
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.510
in order to pump blood to the entire body.

30
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.343
The right ventricle

31
00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:05.720
does not need to generate such high pressures.

32
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.700
Therefore it has thinner walls and less muscle.

33
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.847
There are four valves found in the heart.

34
00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:13.080
The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium

35
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.260
and the right ventricle.

36
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.160
The pulmonic valve is located between the right ventricle

37
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.570
and the pulmonary artery.

38
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.270
The mitral valve is found between the left atrium

39
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.103
and the left ventricle.

40
00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:23.750
And finally, the aortic valve

41
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.440
is found between the left ventricle and they aorta.

42
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.930
All of these valves have three PASPs or leaflets

43
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.170
except for the mitral valve, which has two leaflets.

44
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380
We'll talk more about that in a minute.

45
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.410
Shown on the screen is a cardiac MRI image

46
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.320
from a patient of mine.

47
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.770
And I've shown you this to demonstrate

48
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.970
the anterior posterior relationship

49
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.710
of structures inside the chest,

50
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.650
including the heart and great vessels.

51
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.720
So to help orient you,

52
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.670
this is a cross section through the chest.

53
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.900
The black areas on the sides are the lungs

54
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.580
and in the middle of the picture is the heart and the aorta.

55
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.360
Contrast material has been injected

56
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.760
into the vascular system, so that blood appears white.

57
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.100
So in the front of the chest,

58
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.687
we have a structure that is holding blood,

59
00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:01.080
and that is the right ventricle.

60
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.430
Notice that it's an anterior structure.

61
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.670
The right ventricle is anterior to other parts of the heart

62
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.070
and therefore it's often injured in penetrating trauma

63
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.670
that goes through the chest wall.

64
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.290
Though other structures can also be damaged as well.

65
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.450
Behind the right ventricle, there's another structure

66
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.030
holding blood and that is the left ventricle.

67
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.920
Notice that the left ventricle is surrounded by these walls,

68
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.090
which are relatively thick,

69
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.010
notice also that the right ventricle

70
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.240
has walls that are thinner

71
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.890
just like we talked about on the last picture.

72
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.490
This structure in the back of the chest

73
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.690
that I'm circling with my pen is the left atrium.

74
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.930
Notice that the left atrium

75
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.410
sits right on top of this black hole here,

76
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.750
that black hole is the esophagus

77
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.600
and it sits just behind the left atrium.

78
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.360
Behind the esophagus, you find another circular structure

79
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.050
that contains blood and that is the aorta.

80
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.150
So it's helpful to remember that the esophagus sits between

81
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.500
the left atrium and the aorta.

82
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.220
This will help you understand why cardiologists like me

83
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.800
sometimes take pictures of the heart

84
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.110
by inserting a probe in the esophagus.

85
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.910
That test is called a transesophageal echocardiogram.

86
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.410
And the reason we do this is because the esophagus

87
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.390
is right next to the left atrium and the aorta.

88
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.630
It's also very close to the mitral valve right here.

89
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.670
So we can get very close up pictures of these structures

90
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.990
if we place an ultrasound probe in the esophagus.

91
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.050
You should also be aware that if the left atrium

92
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.690
becomes massively dilated,

93
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.240
it can potentially compress the esophagus

94
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.060
and cause dysphasia, this is rare but it's sometimes occurs

95
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.440
in cases of severe mitral stenosis.

96
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.010
And they like you to understand for your boards,

97
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.010
what can be affected

98
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.570
if the left atrium becomes massively dilated.

99
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.760
And now that you've seen this picture,

100
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.920
hopefully this will help you remember

101
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.790
that the esophagus is right next to the left atrium.

102
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.530
Let's talk about coronary arteries.

103
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.090
If you look at the picture on the screen,

104
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.140
this red structure here

105
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.890
that I'm drawing a line through with my pen is they aorta.

106
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.180
Coming off of the aorta

107
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.250
are two vessels that supply blood to the heart.

108
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.940
The first one is called the left main coronary artery.

109
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.850
It bifurcates into two vessels, the LAD,

110
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.050
the left anterior descending coronary artery,

111
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.240
and the left circumflex coronary artery.

112
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.570
The LAD artery supplies blood to the interior walls

113
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.600
of the left ventricle,

114
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.630
the left circumflex supplies blood to the lateral wall

115
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.380
of the left ventricle.

116
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.390
Also coming off of the aorta is the right coronary artery.

117
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.290
It supplies blood to the right ventricle

118
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.150
and then wraps around the side of the heart

119
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.070
and goes underneath.

120
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.700
The posterior descending artery

121
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.970
is not shown in this picture,

122
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.240
but it supplies blood to the inferior wall

123
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.980
of the left ventricle.

124
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.490
In about 90% of people,

125
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.090
the PDA is a branch of the right coronary artery

126
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.320
and we call those people right dominant.

127
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.260
In 10% of people, the PDA

128
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.230
is a branch of the left circumflex,

129
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.343
and we call those people left dominant.

130
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.050
Venous blood that drains away from the myocardium

131
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.580
goes into a structure called a coronary sinus,

132
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.250
not shown on this picture.

133
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.780
Coronary sinus drains into the right atrium,

134
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.600
just like lots of other venous blood.

135
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.530
And you're sometimes asked on board exams,

136
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.530
what could cause a dilated or enlarged coronary sinus?

137
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.660
And the answer is anything that raises the pressure

138
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.130
in the right atrium because the coronary sinus

139
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.530
drains blood into the right atrium.

140
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.460
If the pressure is high in the right atrium,

141
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.010
coronary sinus can become enlarged.

142
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.760
When you hear people talking about myocardial infarctions,

143
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.130
they'll often say that a patient

144
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.520
had an anterior wall myocardial infarctions

145
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.960
or an inferior wall or a lateral wall myocardial infarction.

146
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.210
And what they're referring to when they use those terms

147
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.880
are the walls of the left ventricle.

148
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.510
When people have heart attacks,

149
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.000
we wanna know which walls of the left ventricle

150
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.890
are involved.

151
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.790
And it's important for you as a medical student

152
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.890
to understand which blood vessels supply

153
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.300
which walls of the left ventricle.

154
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.400
So let's talk about that now.

155
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.740
These are the coronary artery territories

156
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.440
supplied by each vessel.

157
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.930
So the anterior wall, the anterior septum

158
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.630
between the ventricles and the apex of the left ventricle

159
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.280
is all supplied by the left anterior descending artery.

160
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.590
And this is easy to remember

161
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.660
because the artery has the word anterior in its name.

162
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.410
The lateral wall of the left ventricle

163
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.380
is supplied by the left circumflex.

164
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.760
And I used to remember this by just thinking of the vessel

165
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.590
as the lateral circumflex instead of the left circumflex,

166
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.210
use that if you wish.

167
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.960
And then finally the inferior wall and the inferior septum

168
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.440
between the left and right ventricle

169
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.830
are supplied by the PDA.

170
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.780
And as I told you on the last side, in 90% of patients,

171
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.840
the PDA comes off the right coronary artery.

172
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.670
The other 10% of people are called left dominant,

173
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.150
in these patients, the left circumflex supplies the PDA.

174
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.760
And in terms of myocardial infarctions,

175
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.680
the LAD is the artery that is most commonly infarcted.

176
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.247
The circumflex is the least likely to be infarcted

177
00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:20.960
and RCA is in the middle.

178
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.750
And I talk about all this in more detail

179
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.960
in the modules on ischemia.

180
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.300
Let's talk about the mitral valve,

181
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.040
the mitral valve has two leaflets,

182
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.840
an anterior leaflet, and a posterior leaflet.

183
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.790
And the leaflets are tethered to two papillary muscles

184
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.450
by structures called chordae tendineae,

185
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.670
which I'm circling in this picture.

186
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.870
The two papillary muscles

187
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.870
are the anterior lateral papillary muscle

188
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.290
and the posterior medial papillary muscle.

189
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.180
Some people just call them

190
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.050
the anterior and the posterior papillary muscles.

191
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.920
And one thing that's high yield for you to know

192
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.610
about these two papillary muscles,

193
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.710
is that the entire lateral papillary muscle

194
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.790
usually has a dual blood supply

195
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.200
from both the LAD and the circumflex.

196
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.500
This makes it relatively resistant to ischemia

197
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.480
because for example,

198
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.680
if you had an infarction in the left circumflex artery,

199
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.590
the anterolateral papillary muscle

200
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.800
would still get blood from the LAD.

201
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.310
The posterior medial papillary muscle on the other hand

202
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.220
often has a single blood supply,

203
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.650
usually from the right coronary artery

204
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.670
or sometimes from the circumflex.

205
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.760
What this means is that

206
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.030
the posterior medial papillary muscle

207
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.170
is more vulnerable to ischemia

208
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.610
and can potentially rupture

209
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.950
in the setting of a myocardial infarction.

210
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.300
In the ischemia modules, I talk about the fact

211
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.230
that one of the dangerous consequences

212
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.450
of myocardial infarction is for a papillary muscle

213
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.283
to rupture.

214
00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:35.890
The patient will develop severe mitral regurgitation

215
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.040
and acute heart failure and this is often a fatal event.

216
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.060
The papillary muscle that often ruptures

217
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.880
is the posterior medial papillary muscle.

218
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.110
This often occurs in the setting

219
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.750
of an inferior wall myocardial infarction,

220
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.990
and the reason it's the posterior medial papillary muscle

221
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.823
that usually ruptures

222
00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:53.380
is because it has a single blood supply in most cases.

223
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.340
I'll finish by reviewing

224
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.530
the anatomy of the cardiac electrical system.

225
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.320
So electrical activity through the heart

226
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.690
is generated under normal circumstances by the SA node,

227
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.230
which is found on the lateral wall of the right atrium.

228
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.960
From the SA node, electrical activity

229
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.200
goes through both atria,

230
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.770
but it can only reach the ventricle

231
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.720
by going through the AV node.

232
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.330
The AV node is found on the inner atrial septum.

233
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.370
This is the wall between the left and right atria.

234
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.870
From the AV node, electrical activity

235
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.200
travels through the His-Bundle

236
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.300
and then the right bundle branch and the left bundle branch

237
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.970
and finally it travels to the Purkinje fibers.

238
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.880
The His-Bundle is located on the interventricular septum.

239
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.490
This is the wall between the right ventricle

240
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.300
and the left ventricle.

241
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.920
And in general, the SA and AV node

242
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.810
are usually supplied

243
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.480
by branches of the right coronary artery.

244
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.350
And that concludes our module on cardiac anatomy.
